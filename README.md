Center city slam rowing race static site
[centercityslam.com](http://centercityslam.com)

Created this site quickly (like half a day) for an indoor rowing race run by Drexel Rowing alumni once a year.

I used twitter bootstrap for the grid layout and components (if that isn't obvious) and responsive Bootstrap to hide non-essential elements on mobile devices.

This year I added a simple angular app for the results page. We wanted the mobile experience for viewing results to be better than just opening a link to a pdf or xls sheet.
