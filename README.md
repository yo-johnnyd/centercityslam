Center city slam rowing race static site
(centercityslam.com)

Created this site quickly (like half a day) for an indoor rowing race run by Drexel Rowing alumni once a year.

I used twitter bootstrap for the grid layout and components (if that isn't obvious) and use responsive Bootstrap to hide non-essential elements on mobile devices.
